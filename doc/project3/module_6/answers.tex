%   1. A report (of length no greater than 4 pages) that includes
%      the following:
%     • A discussion of the choices made in designing your ANN,
%       particularly those involving topology, activation function,
%       learning rate, momentum, etc. Justify your choices; don’t just
%       state them (2 points).
%     • A description of TWO different representations (i.e., two
%       forms of preprocessing) that were at- tempted, and a comparison
%       of the results achieved by each. These results should involve
%       enough runs (e.g. 50) and analysis to statistically justify the
%       choice of one representation over the other. Use Welch’s T-test
%       (see function scipy.stats.ttest ind with the equal var flag set
%       to False) to verify that one representation beats the other.
%       The random variable to sample from each 2048 run should be the
%       high tile at run’s end (rather than, say, the number of moves or
%       sum total of all tiles). (4 points)
%     • An analysis of your best ANN playing one game of 2048. This should
%       highlight a few points in the game where it made smart decisions,
%       and others where it appeared to make unwise moves (unless, of
%       course, your ANN plays perfectly). (2 points)
