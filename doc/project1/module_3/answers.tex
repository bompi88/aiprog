%% A 3-page report (5 points) that:
% 1. Clearly documents the representations (variables, domains and constraints)
% that you devised for solving nonograms.
% 2. Explains the heuristics used for this problem. Note that heuristics appear 
% in at least two places in A*-GSP: a) in A*â€™s traditional h function, and b) 
% in the choice of a variable on which to base the next assumption. Both (and 
% others, if relevant) should be mentioned in the report.
% 3. Briefly overviews the primary subclasses and methods needed to specialize 
% your general-purpose A*-GAC system to handle nonograms.
% 4. Mentions any other design decisions that are, in your mind, critical to 
% getting the system to perform well.
