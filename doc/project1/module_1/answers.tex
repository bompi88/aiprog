%% A 3-page report describing the central aspects of your A* program, such as
% the agenda and how it is managed. This must clearly and concisely document
% the generality of your program: it should illustrate how your program can
% easily be reused on other search tasks, with only a little subclassing needed
%for each new task. So the core code should NOT have details specific to the
% navigation task. The report must also describe your heuristic function and
% your method for generating successor states. The report must NOT exceed 3
% pages, including all diagrams, code segments, etc. (4 points)
