%% The report will be no longer than 3 pages and will include the following:
% 1. Verification of the generality of your A* algorithm. Any aspect of A* that 
% is specifically geared toward CSP and GAC should be in subclasses, not the 
% core A* classes.
% 2. Verification of the generality of your A*-GAC algorithm. Any aspect of 
% A*-GAC that is specifically geared toward VC should be in subclasses, not the 
% core code. You will be reusing A*-GAC on other assignments, so the core should
% be easily extendable via subclassing.
% 3. Verification of a clean separation between your Constraint Network (CNET) 
% and the VIs and CIs of the search states, as shown in Figure 4.
% 4. A clear explanation (with small code segments) of: a) the manner in which 
% your system creates code chunks on the fly, or b) the general workings of your 
% hand-built interpreter for executing constraints in a canonical form, or c) 
% your work-around for avoiding both code chunks and a hand-built interpreter.
